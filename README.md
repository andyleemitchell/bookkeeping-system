# What is this?
This is a warehouse and bookshop organisation system to show the use of object
oriented programming in C++. It was created as a lab exercise in college, but
extended outside of the module. The code is still a work in progress.

# Todo
## Basics
- create a makefile for the project
- clean up the code
- refactor the code so that the bookshop and warehouse vectors update
    simultaneously
- fix the inputs so they allow spaces in titles etc

## More advanced
- move the ui to a curses based tui
- move to a more robust data storage design
- automatic completion of book metadata from their titles
	- possibly some python webscraping integration?

 <<testing>> I messed up my github email - test to see if it is fixed

<!--- Add in compilations/installation options here when makefile is done --->
